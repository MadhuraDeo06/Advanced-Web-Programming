            Character Information : <p>Stefan was described as a "beautiful young man" who turns out to be a Vampire 171 years old, who develops a "strong connection" with "tragic heroine" Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev).[1] Wesley described the young Stefan as "naive and willing to ride whatever wave life threw" him, because he was "easily manipulated" and "innocent" with a "beautiful young soul". However, Stefan at the age of 160 years has more wisdom in him.[2] Stefan consumes animal blood, refusing to kill humans due to the guilt that he killed his own father. Damon on the other hand, does feed on humans.</p>
